# Welcome to Your Personalize Day Planner!

The code in this repository is hosted here : https://sabinehutter.github.io/Homework5/

This day planner allows you  enter in task for certain times of the day and saves them so when you come back they are still there. 

The red time represents the current hour, grey is past hours, and green is future hours. 

# The following code is for the assignment below 

 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

<!-- html -->
<!-- create time blocks per hour in javascript -->
<!-- create by setting each hour to its own div with specific id (check slack)-->
<!-- text of div corresponds to moment.js -->
<!-- text area is where teh evetnts of the hour are typed (remember to add descriiption to class) -->
<!-- check CSS for appropriate class descriptions (.description id) -->
<!-- save button to save local storage -->
<!-- add current day with moment.js in id currenday -->



<!-- ------------------------------ -->

<!-- JS -->
<!-- add current day with moment.js in id currenday -->
<!-- add function to save text area value to local storage with key of hour save button clicked add.on("click", function()) -->
<!-- get information from local stoage when document ready  -->
<!-- reload - get from local storage  -->
<!-- use for loop to read value from time property and assign as text back in element (using its class and id description) -->
<!-- check if current time slot is less, current, or future  -->
